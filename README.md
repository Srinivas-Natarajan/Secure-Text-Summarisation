# ECIES

## Abstract

With the rise of the internet, it has become more and more common for important, critical documents to be shared through electronic means. This means that it has become essential that documents and important details be kept confidential through the means of encryption. ECC has risen in popularity and is dubbed “The Successor to RSA” as it is capable of achieving the same security of a 1024 bit RSA key with just 208 bits. Thus, it is the most optimal method for securing data against breaches and unauthorized access. <br/> Documents have also grown in size over time as more detail can be stored due to larger and faster storage availability. Excessive amounts of time is wasted on reading filler and unnecessary content in documents to understand them and this becomes an issue as it limits the productivity of an individual . Skimming through large documents may also lead to users missing important details. Hence a smart Natural Language Processing system that can parse through documents / text files / URLs can help save precious time while also conveying all the important facts/details needed.
